Setting up webpack with react

Webpack
webpack.js.org
Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. 
Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
It takes the dependencies and generates a dependency graph allowing web developers to use a modular approach for their web application development purposes.
The bundler can be used from the command line, or can be configured using a config file which is named webpack.config.js.
